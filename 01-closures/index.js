/***
 * What is Closures?
 * A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
 * In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 
 * In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
